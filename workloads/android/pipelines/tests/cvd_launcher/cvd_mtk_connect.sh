# Description:
# Script to start/stop MTK Connect agent and testbench for a Cuttlefish
# Virtual Device (CVD) under test.
# The script is intended to be run as root (sudo).
#
# The following variables must be set before running this script:
#
#  - MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN: the URL domain for mtk-connect.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME: the MTK Connect API key username.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD: the MTK Connect API key password.
#
# Optional variables:
#  - MTK_CONNECTED_DEVICES: the number of connected devices.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TESTBENCH: the name of the testbench to create in mtk-connect.
#  - MTK_CONNECT_TEST_ARTIFACT: what is being tested.

# Example Usage:
# sudo \
#   MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN=${MTK_CONNECT_DOMAIN} \
#   MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME=${MTK_CONNECT_USERNAME} \
#   MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD=${MTK_CONNECT_PASSWORD} ../cvd_mtk_connect.sh
